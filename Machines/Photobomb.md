<h4>Summary</h4>

This machine tests a lot of fundamentals about web exploitation, privilege escalation and ENV variables within Linux. It's usage is extremely basic and entertaining, documents for research below.

As a fairly novice Pen Tester (At the time of writing) I'd personally consider this a simply box to crack. As long as you play around with everything at the start, you'll eventually land yourself in the right place just by trial and error, like most things.

<h1> THE TOOLBOX </h1>

This Tools folder is categorised by the following:

• <b> ONLINE: </b> The tool in question has been taken from online and stored away for ease of use. I do not take credit for these in any way.

• <b> LOCAL: </b> I've written these myself or taken inspiration from a book.

Have fun with these, and happy scripting!
